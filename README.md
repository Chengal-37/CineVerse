CineVerse
A Dynamic Movie Browsing Application
MovieHub is a responsive, single-page web application for exploring movies and user reviews. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it connects to The Movie Database (TMDB) API to provide a seamless and interactive browsing experience without the need for a backend.

‚ú® Features
Dynamic Home Page: Displays trending movies in a horizontal slider and categorized lists (e.g., Action, Comedy).

Search and Advanced Filtering: Easily find movies by title or use advanced filters to narrow down results by genre, rating, language, and release year.

Detailed Movie Pages: Click on any movie to view comprehensive details, including the plot, director, top cast members, and runtime.

User Reviews: Leave your own reviews and ratings for any movie. Your reviews are saved locally in the browser's storage.

Responsive UI: The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.

Interactive Design: Includes visual feedback such as a dynamic loading spinner and a movie reel icon for movies without a poster image.

Pagination: Navigate through long lists of search and filter results with intuitive pagination controls.

üíª Technologies Used

CSS3: For all styling, including modern layouts and animations.

JavaScript (ES6+): Powers all dynamic functionality, API requests, and DOM manipulation.

The Movie Database (TMDB) API: The primary source for all movie data.
